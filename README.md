# FlappyBird
Flappy Bird clone I made using pygame but with blocks instead of actual art. 

Welcome to my second pygame attempt. 

This time i replicated flappy bird using the pygame library, but due to my terrible art skills the bird and poles are
just colored blocks. 

Once the game begins, you have to press the space bar to start. the space bar is also used to jump. Your score is displayed
in console.
